# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned how to use the library by looking at the examples provides by the original author. I analyzed each line in each example and compared the uses of specific methods to the original source code. One aspect of the module's code that made it easy to understand was the naming of functions and variables. The author used relevant and consistent names for functions and variables that it was helped with understanding the code line by line. One change that would have made it easier was for the author to include uses of the functions within the get method. For example, the function guess_type under the get method was difficult to understand.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> The process of writing comments that raise the level of abstraction would mean to write it comments in a way that a user understand the purpose of a function or method without having to understand the code. A effective comment would  be one that doesn't reveal any internal implementations while explaining the function of the code.
